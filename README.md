 # Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is my first attempt of  building and publishing a website. I wanted to challenge myself and learn new skills in front-end computer engineering.
I wanted to build this website as a base line of what I'm able to achieve and see how I improve throughout my career as a computer engineer.
I solved issues such as where I can store all my prework study material during my front-end development bootcamp.
I have learned basics in JavaScript how to write a simple function and loops, also I challenged myself to put a marquee with a moving gif as I thought it was interesting with what you can do with HTML and CSS.
